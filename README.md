👋 Hi, I’m Rahul!

👀 Passionate about fintech, AI, and exploring innovative products.

🌱 Currently leveling up my web development skills to enrich my journey as a product manager.

💞️ Always open to collaborating on fintech or any product that solves real end-consumer problems—making life simpler and better in meaningful ways.

📫 The best way to reach me is via LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/rahul164/

⚡ Fun fact: I love diving into sci-fi & mythical movies and TV series. When I'm not watching, you’ll find me cooking up dishes from Indian, Italian, Mediterranean, to Chinese cuisines. I'm all about trying new experiences and learning something new!
